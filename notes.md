# React Native

React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React primitives render to native platfrom UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do. React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise on your users' experience. It provides a core set of platform agnostic native components like `View`, `Text`, and `Image` that map directly to the platform's native UI building blocks.
